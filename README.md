BetaChess
=========

BetaChess is a chess engine that follows the UCI protocol.  
Most of the work has already been done (considering the fact the program is already a working engine that's decently strong) however, its far from perfect and every improvement or bugfix will be highly appreciated.  
If you want to improve on this program, you need to make sure you know what you are doing. To learn more about chess AI, go here: http://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/  

List Of Bugs:

* Search doesn't consider enpassant moves even though they are generated my movegen
* 3-fold repetition check doesn't work as its supposed to
